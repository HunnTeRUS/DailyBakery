# DailyBakery

This app has the function combined with the DailyBakery Owner app, where the Daily Bakery has the function of providing all bakeries near you within a radius of 10KM.

You can choose the bakery closest to you, activate the route to get there or ask to be notified when the next batch of warm bread comes out! The perfect application for those who love warm breads and who like to find them at their own bakery.

The application will be available on the Play Store next year, with the backend already live within the Heroku platform.
